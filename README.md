## Software development challenge for a job application at LIS - PUCRS/HP

### **Prerequisites:**
* .NET Framework version 4.7.2

### **Usage:**
To use the app, you must put the text file you want to translate in the **input** folder. *(obs: must be a .txt file)* 
You can open the app by double click or by command line.

#### If you open the app from the command line, you can send the name of the text file as arguments:

After that the program will search for the best key to solve the encryption and show the resulting text on the console.
